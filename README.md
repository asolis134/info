Reason for interest
For me this is part of building up my own library security tool. While this script can be used in some scenarios to get some initial info on a device as a defender it’s most optimally used in offensive scenarios.&nbsp;

3 main points
Get system information from the target device
Evaluate python’s ability to take screenshots across different platfoms
A partial evaluation of different platform to produce a tool that will identify systems


Future direction
-Attempt to get a screenshot of the active/focus window on Mac
-Implement a keylogger along with arg to determine usage of the tool


Requirements
- pip install pyobjc
- pip install geocoder
- pip install PIL
- pip install keyboard
